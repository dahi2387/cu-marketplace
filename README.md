# cu-marketplace
1. Application Description:
  Marketplace for students to buy/sell student tickets. Students will be able to purchase or sell their tickets at the “market price” ensuring that the price of the ticket is the fair value. Students will register/login using their CU identikey to ensure student status.

  The student will see a list of events, with buy and sell buttons for each event. Clicking buy or sell for whatever event they choose will go to the CU identikey login, which will then lead them to a screen that allows them to say what price they are looking to buy or sell for, and for buyers also just a list of tickets already available on the website. This would then lead to a checkout screen where the student for buyer or seller would connect to a payment service.

  Students will also be able to see their tickets that they currently have in their possession, and would be able to transfer tickets, share listings, or sell their tickets.
